## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

As an **AI Product Manager**, your morning is precious. You need to:
- 📈 **Stay ahead** on AI breakthroughs and tech trends
- 🌍 **Monitor global markets** that impact your products  
- 💰 **Spot money-making opportunities** before others
- 🎯 **Focus on what matters** to your specific role

But scanning news sites, Twitter, and reports takes **30+ minutes every morning**. 

**Our solution?** An AI-powered morning brief that:
- ✅ **Learns your preferences** (AI focus? Startup news? Investment opportunities?)
- ✅ **Aggregates from 15+ sources** in seconds
- ✅ **Delivers before your first coffee** (8 AM sharp)
- ✅ **Adapts over time** based on your feedback

## 🚀 One-Minute Setup

### Interactive Installation
```bash
# Clone and configure in one command
git clone https://github.com/huangyixing520-tech/morning-brief-skill.git
cd morning-brief-skill
./init.sh  # This asks about your preferences!
```

### What Happens During Setup?
The system will ask you:
1. **Your name and occupation** (AI Product Manager, Founder, Investor, etc.)
2. **Your interests** (AI, startups, tech investments, etc.)
3. **Your money focus** (product opportunities, investments, side hustles)
4. **Content priorities** (rate AI news vs global news vs money opportunities)
5. **Delivery preferences** (time, frequency, platform)

**Result**: A completely personalized morning routine starting tomorrow.
